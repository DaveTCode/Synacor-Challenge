# Synacor Challenge 

The synacor challenge is a coding challenge run by Eric Wastl of Advent of Code fame. For details see https://challenge.synacor.com/

This is an implementation of the challenge in C# (& some F# for one portion).

**Whilst this repo does include spoilers I highly recommend doing a clean room implementation of your own solution, it's _far_ more fun!**
